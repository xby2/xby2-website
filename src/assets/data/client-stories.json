        "content": "<h1>Opportunity<\/h1>\r\n<p>A large, commercial lines property & casualty carrier was falling behind the competitive curve in technological capability and wanted an independent and objective set of perspectives on its IT strategy. The insurer needed to identify and prioritize initiatives that would improve its service to agents and policyholders and increase its competitive differentiation. The insurer had a strategic planning process in place that included a regular review of IT activity; however, the IT department wanted to validate the current IT plan and establish a detailed roadmap to ensure that technology enablers were aligned with business objectives.<\/p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the insurer had begun modernizing legacy systems to respond to business pain points, but had concerns about the modernization path being taken and whether that path led to a sustainable enterprise architecture. Most important, the carrier wanted to ensure that any activity they undertook increased value to policyholders and agents and positioned the company for the future.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Engagement<\/h1>\r\n<p>X by 2 conducted an in-depth enterprise architecture and IT roadmap assessment, engaging with all key constituents across the business to capture the as-is state of core processes, systems, data, technology and architecture. Because users had been reluctant to bring problems directly to IT, having an objective third party was important to obtain unfiltered input from the full user base. This assessment was also combined with market research on competitors\u2019 capabilities, industry best practices and X by 2\u2019s extensive industry experience.<\/p>\r\n<p>Next, X by 2 identified key pain points and capability gaps that involved people, business processes and technology. Key findings included a lack of self-service capabilities, lack of business process automation, functional gaps in core applications and insufficient data access and analysis. As a result, the carrier was experiencing a high cost of service request compared to competitors, while agents and customers dealt with reduced responsiveness and error-prone business processes. This led to an image in the marketplace of being a less technologically advanced carrier, causing the carrier to miss out on revenue opportunity.<\/p>\r\n<p>X by 2\u2019s analysis incorporated an in-depth architecture assessment that validated whether or not areas of the client\u2019s current IT strategy would close these gaps and support targeted business objectives. It prioritized major business and IT initiatives that would improve the company\u2019s competitive position. It also established a future target state for architecture (data, business, application and enterprise) and provided a roadmap for achieving those states. Additionally, the assessment included recommended changes involving people, business processes and IT organization that would enable the client to best achieve its business objectives.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Impact<\/h1>\r\n<p>Due to X by 2\u2019s analysis, the client discovered that it did not have the architecture and technology needed to support business objectives at an enterprise level. In particular, the agent portal was identified as an area where the insurer was significantly behind the competitive curve. The top systems initiatives targeted were modernizing its policy administration and claims system, creating an enterprise portal, developing advanced data analysis, data mining and ad-hoc reporting capabilities.<\/p>\r\n<p>In each of these areas, X by 2 delivered recommendations for solutions that would support the desired future state while also providing scalability and alignment with targeted enterprise architecture objectives. According to the client, a key differentiator in X by 2\u2019s work product was the creation of a detailed, documented and actionable plan for achieving the desired to-be state.<\/p>\r\n<p>The client used X by 2\u2019s objective assessment to make critical changes to IT processes that included modifying roles and responsibilities, elevating the importance of the architectural role and establishing better project communications between business and IT teams.   The analysis was objective and balanced, indicating both the areas where IT activity did not align with best practices or where they were behind peer companies, as well as the areas where IT goals and activity did align with business objectives.<\/p>\r\n<p>Today, the client has a roadmap in place that supports IT strategic planning and serves as a key communication device with the C-level suite to obtain buy-in and budget approval on IT investments. As a result of X by 2\u2019s enterprise architecture assessment, the client has gained confidence in its strategic planning process and has put an IT roadmap in place targeted toward increasing its market advantage.<\/p>\r\n"

A key aspect of this modernization was to increase process automation and efficiency, due to the expectation of increased customers and service and support processes moving forward. In its current state, this client needed forty-five to sixty days to process an application, an unacceptable amount of time in a rapidly modernizing industry.  Further, a timeline of roughly eighteen to twenty-four months to create new or update existing products in the life division was similarly unacceptable. The market motivation for creating faster and more robust services and processes was to meet customer expectations by enhancing the overall customer experience.  This would be accomplished by reducing the time for processing applications and for creating new products.  The insurer also sought better self-service capabilities for both the customer and agents as part of the modernization.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Engagement<\/h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The engagement began with a current state business analysis. In completing the analysis, X by 2 highlighted the fact that from a technology perspective the Life company was effectively part of the P&C line of business.  That meant that most of the life business functions were part of larger corporate functions, including the life claims function.  Among other observations, X by 2 identified a completely manual vendor integration process wherein individuals were required to log into vendor websites in order to receive integration requirements.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the current state business analysis, X by 2 identified pain points within the client\u2019s Life division. This identification process covered several areas of the business, including new business and underwriting, policyholder and agent self-service, quoting, among several others. Through system analysis and individual interviews, X by 2 created a list of current state pain points in order to understand what the future state should address. This also led to the creation of a current state technical architecture to document the Life division\u2019s technology operations.  This technical analysis identified the legacy policy system\u2019s many limitations as a result of its home-built legacy Cobol construction and customization.  Additionally, the database in use was sub-optimized by using different schemas for different applications with unique table names for each schema.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>After identifying the current state and the associated pain points, X by 2 conducted a buy vs. build analysis of the current market offerings. This process started with a broad evaluation of the market for potential product candidates before diving into a detailed analysis that mapped the client\u2019s functional pain points to a product\u2019s ability to solve them. Other factors analyzed included scalability and maintainability, ease of integration and customization, and total cost of ownership. Following this analysis, X by 2 concluded that the market did not have any good product offerings for the client\u2019s life core system.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Impact<\/h1>\r\n\r\n<p>After concluding that building a custom solution was the best option for this client \u2013 given the current state of the Life product marketplace - X by 2 created a 5 year horizon future state architecture. From there, a detailed implementation roadmap was created, including recommendations on project organization and team structure.  X by 2 successfully led the implementation of the new system and continues to provide leadership for other modernization efforts for the Life division of the carrier. These areas include the creation of agent portals to streamline quoting and application submission, the integration of the Life ODS with internal and external entities, and a reduction in policy issuance timing, all while providing better visibility of the process for agents and policyholders.<\/p>"

        "content": "<h1>Opportunity<\/h1>\r\n<p>In order to build on its success in an increasingly competitive and time-sensitive market, our client looked to deploy new capabilities to its agents while exploring new channels and market opportunities. The client needed the ability to bring new products to market quickly and efficiently, deliver self-service capabilities to independent agents, position itself for a future move into the direct-to-consumer sales channel and create a platform to enable cross-selling and up-selling across products and lines. <\/p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the insurer could not achieve these objectives due to proprietary legacy platforms that prevented the quick response to new market and process opportunities.  As a result, the client needed to convert its entire policy administration platform to a modern architecture, but lacked the internal knowledge to make an accurate technology assessment. Additionally, a highly matrixed organizational structure created the potential for friction among stakeholders, making consensus on key issues difficult to achieve.<\/p>\r\n<p>As the project progressed the client\u2019s IT and project leadership guided the efforts, made changes, and reshaped approaches with the aim of accelerating the launch. The client needed an objective external viewpoint of the project, including a review of the overall architectural approach and its use of the agile development process methodology.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Engagement<\/h1>\r\n<p>X by 2 led the agile architecture review as part of an in-flight policy administration initiative. The review began with an analysis of the overall project that encompassed three major buckets: scope management, team organization and resources, and development process and methodology. Initially, an approach was put in place to establish a breadth-first view of the key project dimensions that identified areas for a deeper review and analysis.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Scope Management Issues and Observations<\/h2>\r\n<p>The client\u2019s use of lengthy use cases created months of review before any software could be created, which elongated the iteration process. This led to problems with testability, communication, coordination and work management. Overall, scope management was not change-friendly due to excessive document creation and rework that became a point of tension between business and IT functions.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Team Structure and Resources Issues and Observations<\/h2>\r\n<p>Design and development on the project was done offshore, leading to the typical challenges surrounding communication, skill sets and time zones. One of the difficulties encountered was a general mismatch of culture in which the offshore partner was used to the parent company\u2019s way of doing things and \u2018never said no\u2019 to the client.  Roles were often too fine-grained with narrow responsibilities within the onshore team, and the skills and experience of the onshore and offshore team were not always adequate for the project.  As a result of the X by 2 analysis the client introduced a SWAT approach and implemented elements of collocation in which onshore and offshore team members worked in each other\u2019s physical locations for defined periods of time. This enabled improved communication, including all offshore communication being channeled through one individual for coordination and prioritization.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Development Process and Methodology Issues and Observations<\/h2>\r\n<p>The client lacked clarity on methodology and lacked experience with agile development.  This lack of project clarity led to confusion for both onshore and offshore teams.  The onshore team expected the offshore team to collaborate and work with high-level direction consistent with agile practices; however, the offshore team expected the very detailed specifications of a waterfall approach. This communication disconnect between onshore analysis and offshore development led to significant quality issues and rework. Additionally, there was a misalignment between offshore and onshore teams for Quality Assurance expectations, and there was no single entity that focused on the holistic nature of the final solution from both the business and technology perspectives. These difficulties led to an unmet expectation that there would be a full set of detailed requirements and design documents to continually evolve the system.<\/p>\r\n<h1>Impact<\/h1>\r\n<p>Following the initial analysis period, X by 2 made recommendations to solve the pain points identified. These recommendations provided an objective viewpoint for the client to begin solving issues surrounding overall architectural approach and agile process methodology within their policy administration initiative.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Scope Breakdown and Management Recommendations<\/h2>\r\n<p>To address scope management, X by 2 recommended using business scenario-based use cases rather than screen shots.  The client should shift to smaller iterations that took no longer than 4-8 weeks to produce software, and where practical, interim releases to assess team progress. More broadly, the amount of planning should be reduced and the lean principle of eliminating waste should be applied to invest in value-added planning only. Finally, root causes of failures need to be identified to get business buy-in for a flexible scope, and the business should be allowed to determine priorities.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Team Structure and Resources Recommendation<\/h2>\r\n<p>X by 2 suggested that the client create more coarse-grained team roles and put in place an approach to appropriately credential onshore and offshore resource roles.  Team head-count should be reduced resulting from more coarse-grained roles that lead to smaller teams, helping to reduce communication overhead. This allows the best resources to spend more time actually doing work as opposed to coordinating and communicating. The quality and coordination of architectural solutions could be improved by creating a focused group to ensure the consistent and holistic nature of solutions from both the business and technology perspectives.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Development Process and Methodology Recommendations<\/h2>\r\n<p>The client was advised to create a lighter process for documentation using clear and realistic goals for why process steps or documents were required.  The best practice is to create higher-level and more sustainable artifacts that lead directly to working software, as that is the most important indicator of progress. Acceptance tests need to be created as part of defining and documenting business scenario-based use cases for requirements.<\/p>"
