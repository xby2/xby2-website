However, this insurer\u2019s legacy claims administration platform was no longer up to the task. Specifically, the carrier needed to achieve:<\/p><p><b>Reduced claims cycle time.<\/b> Featuring only a \u201Cgreen-screen\u201D interface, the system\u2019s complex navigation made it difficult for staff to learn and use. The insurer needed a system that would enable it to streamline and automate claims processes from intake to settlement. The solution needed to include robust workflows that would guide claim reps and CSRs through the process and allow better management visibility to status of claims. And finally, it needed to integrate effectively with both internal and external systems to eliminate discontinuities in claims .<\/p><p><b>Reduction of allocated and un-allocated loss adjustment expense.<\/b> The company needed to automatically segment claims into those that could be handled via straight-through processing and those that required handling by adjustors. This would provide better workload distribution and more effective management of internal resources.<\/p><p><b>Creation of a flexible platform to respond to business needs and market conditions.<\/b> The insurer\u2019s legacy mainframe claims system lacked web-based capabilities and the ability to automate business processes or create new workflows. Its COBOL coding also made it expensive to maintain and resulted in a backlog of system change requests. The company was under increased competitive pressures because carriers with newer and flexible claims platforms could resolve claims more quickly, provide better customer service, and offer web-based self-service. Other carriers were also able to effectively automate claims workflows and claims-related processes, such as fraud detection.<\/p>\r\n        <p><b>Service for a changing customer base.<\/b> The demographics of both the agents and the customers of this company had changed. Users who had grown up with the web, instant messaging, and other social networking technologies demanded to conduct business and file and monitor claims over the web instead of through phone, fax, or green-screen system interfaces. It was clear to the company that it needed to upgrade its claims technology. However, it lacked an internal consensus on the best course of action for its unique operations, including whether to buy a claims administration solution, rearchitect its existing platform, or build a new system internally using investments that had already been made in development platforms and BPM technology. Faced with very important drivers and myriad set of options, the company turned to X by 2 to create a technology strategy that would enable best-in-class claims processing.<\/p><h1>Insight<\/h1><p>The insurer engaged X by 2 to provide a detailed and objective analysis that would translate into the best solution for its business. The company chose X by 2 for breadth and depth of expertise, a specialization in the insurance industry, and successes with previous engagements. X by 2 began by developing a thorough understanding of the company\u2019s goals and objectives for optimizing and differentiating its claims process as well as the company\u2019s existing systems environment and enterprise architecture. Working with the insurer\u2019s business staff, X by 2 established and prioritized goals and objectives. Analyzing both strategic problems and tactical pain points, X by 2 identified root causes of problems, tied root causes to limitations in the current claim platform and architecture, and arrived at new business and architecture requirements. The analysis included both the \u201Cbuild\u201D and \u201Cbuy\u201D options and fully explored the impact of the different implementation alternatives, internal development resource requirements, and overall risks of either option. All leading solutions in the marketplace, based on X by 2\u2019s industry experience and a thorough review of independent analyst research, were considered. X by 2 accomplished the following:<\/p><p><b>Established critical success factors.<\/b> Based on X by 2\u2019s analysis, knowledge of the solution marketplace and claims best practices, a thorough set of business and architecture requirements was established against which vendor solutions could be measured. X by 2 was also able to assess pre-existing assets at the client and from global consultants and systems integrators in order to jumpstart the project and reduce costs and risk.<\/p><p><b>Identified and evaluated required resources.<\/b> X by 2 assessed the sources that would be needed on both the business and technology side to ensure project success. These included both domestic and off shore consulting firms and system integrators, who were evaluated for their ability to address the critical success factors that were established. The existing systems were then analyzed relative to the functional needs of the various user groups, the technology architecture, capabilities for integration with legacy systems, and total costs of ownership.  X by 2 recommended a course of action that would meet business objectives and fulfill the needs of the enterprise.<\/p><p><b>Identified potential risk areas and established risk mitigation strategies.<\/b> X by 2 conducted a deep architectural review of these systems, conducting multiple, full-day meetings with vendors and putting systems through customer-specific business as well as architectural \u201Cuse case\u201D scenarios that would be encountered in production, rather than simply relying on vendors\u2019 prepared demos and scenarios. In addition to assessing specific features and functionality of systems, vendor solutions were evaluated for their technology architecture, security, workflow functionality, integration capabilities, and SOA readiness. X by 2 also calculated the total cost of ownership of each platform, including upfront development and customization costs, licensing and maintenance, hardware and software requirements, and support.<\/p><h1>Impact<\/h1><p>X by 2 performed an objective and thorough analysis of the entire spectrum of options available, including solutions developed using in-house resources and available within the marketplace. Because X by 2 evaluated available options across multiple dimensions, the insurer can fully understand the business implications and consequences of all viable choices. Due to the extensive due diligence done, the insurer was able to embark on the initiative with clear understanding of common expectations across business and IT, which is essential to success, as well as potential challenges likely to be encountered and ways to overcome them. Additionally, by providing an objective voice that speaks the language of both business and technology, X by 2 enabled the company to bridge the gap between business and development staff and, within the IT organization itself, between the proponents of \u201Cbuy\u201D and advocates of \u201Cbuild.\u201D It also allowed all constituents to have confidence that every aspect of the situation was considered and that all voices were heard, which made it easier for people to rally behind final decision. Today, the insurer has an action plan that is rooted in factual information and aligned with its enterprise architecture. This framework provides a specific roadmap for success regardless of the option chosen. With clear direction established, X by 2 provided technical\/architecture leadership for implementation and successfully launched across all lines of business.<\/p>"

In a continuing effort to grow and evolve their programs, X by 2 collaborated with the client and developed advanced medical informatics and reporting capabilities that enabled them to better evaluate the impact of systemic improvements in care processes and more quickly adapt to industry-wide changes that result from health care reform.\r\nThrough its promotion of a PCMH model, our client worked to dramatically improve care quality, lower costs, increase satisfaction by providing incentives for physicians to focus on the overall health and wellness of each patient, and empower members to take more control of their own health outcomes and costs. The health insurer\u2019s ability to grow its programs; however, had become hindered by its inability to efficiently collect and analyze data for various initiatives. \r\nTo help maintain its edge and continually evolve the incentive programs, our client required advanced data, analytics and reporting capabilities to enable the identification and evaluation of systemic improvements in care processes.   A key element of this was the measurement of initiative effectiveness from the perspective of results, incentive payout, projected savings and impact on the quality of care.\r\n<h1>Engagement<\/h1>\r\n<p>X by 2 led the strategy and development efforts to deliver advanced analytic and reporting capabilities for our client\u2019s value partnership programs. In close collaboration with key business and IT leadership, X by 2 developed a single clinical programs and medical informatics approach that consolidated the insurer\u2019s vast amount of core data related to its incentive programs into a new data mart that enabled streamlined, accurate, and consistent analytic capabilities and reports in just nine months. \r\nThe data mart consolidated core membership, claims, and provider data from disparate sources (e.g. Commercial, Medicare Advantage, etc.) into a single repository and automated advanced methods to enable analysts to identify and better understand the relationships between concepts such as:\r\n<p>A Unified Person:  identification and tracking of a person\u2019s membership over their lifetime.\r\n<p>Care Relationship:  identification and tracking of a person\u2019s Primary Care Physician (PCP) over their lifetime. \r\n<p>Encounter:  identification of inpatient, emergency, and outpatient encounters and the tracking of a person\u2019s interactions with a health facility. The data mart was also integrated with analytical engines like HEDIS engine and Symmetry to provide industry standard best practice metrics for measuring a person\u2019s health.\r\n<p>This combination of data allowed our client to more thoroughly evaluate a person\u2019s health experience, holistically view a person\u2019s care ongoing care, and create advanced reporting that is shared internally and with providers. These reports are related to evidence-based care, generic prescription dispensing, inpatient use, claims, etc.\r\n<h1>Impact<\/h1>\r\n<p>With the implementation of the data mart, the health insurer is better equipped to evolve and grow its industry leading physician incentive and PCMH programs with advanced analytics. What X by 2 delivered became the single source for all analytics and reporting for our client\u2019s cross departmental data scientists, statisticians, etc. Additionally, as industry-wide changes continue via health care reform (e.g. performance-based payments), our client will be well-positioned for competitive advantage. \r\n"
