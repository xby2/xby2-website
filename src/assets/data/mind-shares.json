        "content": "<p>Change has become the mantra across the insurance industry. Whether it\u2019s health, life or P&C, the change tsunami continues to wash over them all. In fact, change has always been a part of the insurance industry, and over its history, the industry has evolved to adopt and adapt to hundreds of years of social, economic and technological change.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\u2019s a recent argument that the difference now is that the pace of change has dramatically increased, and that\u2019s probably true. And while that increased pace of change has delivered better and more innovative solutions, it has also exacerbated the gap between technological change and people\u2019s ability to accept and absorb that change. And while that may not be a completely new problem, it is a problem that that industry still struggles with, and often to its detriment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ironically, the insurance industry was an early adopter of computerized business when it invested heavily in mainframe platforms and the large and complex software systems that were created for them. Having done that however, the industry did not continue to evolve is technology and software problems, leading to the kinds of process and culture issues the sector now faces.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a cultural change management problem, but not in the traditional sense of the term. The change management challenge of these times for insurers is finding ways to get all of their key stakeholders\u2014customers, patients, agents, employees, providers, etc.\u2014less resistant to change and more open to innovation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It used to be true that the biggest reason for the failure of business technology initiatives was that the technology itself wasn\u2019t quite ready for prime time. That orientation has now flipped, and while the technology has gotten progressively better and easier to implement, initiative failures are now usually based on the fact that the incumbent culture is resistant to the change the new technology and process brings. It all begs the continuing question of why people continue to resist change so much?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For better or worse, there\u2019s a plethora of psychological research around that question\u2014along with a lot of pricey consulting engagements\u2014but is there a more common sense, and affordable, way to approach the problem?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For insurers, it\u2019s essentially an economic problem, as a resistance to change that sub-optimizes innovation takes money from the top and bottom lines of insurers. The short answer is that people would rather be comfortable than uncomfortable, and change is uncomfortable.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Creating an Environment that Embraces Change<\/h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that the human nature is unlikely to change much\u2014so fears of learning new things, role diminishment and even potential job loss are not going away\u2014it\u2019s critical that insurers adopt methods and approaches that help people become incrementally more comfortable with change as a constant over time. Of course, this requires focus and support from upper management, and a commitment to creating an environment that embraces change, including the failures that inevitably come with change. Once that duty exists (if it doesn\u2019t exist then just stop because nothing will work) a good place to start the \\\u201Cchange comfortableness\\\u201D process is an agile methodology approach.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many insurers have already adapted such an approach, but the fact that an orientation toward change is so problematic in the industry suggests that many insurers are still just giving lip service to a truly agile approach. It\u2019s one thing to have daily scrum meetings and move business and IT people into the same workspaces. It\u2019s another thing to use the agile values and principles of direct and straightforward communications, accountability for progress, reflecting and adjusting on what worked well and what didn\u2019t, and an openness to quickly move in new directions when required. Most insurers are okay with the former but fall short on the latter.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the keys to an agile development approach is that it eases people into becoming comfortable or at the very least tolerant, of change. It begins to move them from the devils they know\u2014like a waterfall project approach among teams\u2014toward new ways of thinking about how to solve problems. It takes repetition, practice and familiarity to begin to make people comfortable with new ideas, and agile can help to do that.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>An agile approach creates communications channels that likely didn\u2019t exist prior to its implementation. That helps with dismantling the \\\u201Cassumption\\\u201D game present at so many insurers. That game is when one party (typically IT) assumes\u2014 without even creating an open dialogue about the possibilities\u2014that another party (usually business people) won\u2019t engage or be open to change.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many examples of this in action. Many insurers still cling to the \\\"consensus as comfort\\\u201D approach, holding far too many meetings to make decisions on relatively trivial matters. So rather than empowering an employee at the appropriate management level to make making a $10,000 call that will probably work out (but may not), they\u2019ll hold a series of meetings that end up costing more than the projected investment in people\u2019s time and lost opportunity costs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another example is the creation of consensus requirements that lead to bad code and bad systems\u2014the system gets finished, but the long-term costs of remediation and support are significant. Or implementing elaborate change management processes as a way to train people into being comfortable with change. More often than not it just doesn\u2019t work.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Steps to Get Started<\/h1>\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s these prevailing attitudes and actions among insurers that require those who can afford it, to create innovation and investment operations that are entirely separate from the core insurance operations. That\u2019s fine for operational focus, but it doesn\u2019t help to engender the comfortableness with change so necessary across the industry.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there are no easy and quick answers for creating a culture more comfortable with change, there are some steps that any insurer can start with:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><ul><li>Make change a core value of the company. Communicate it, model it, reinforce it and hold people, especially management, accountable for achieving it.<\/li>\r\n<li>Use a truly agile approach to help people become more comfortable with change as a continuous state.<\/li>\r\n<li>Create an environment where people are allowed to make mistakes, but hold them to the tenet of never making the same mistake twice.<\/li>\r\n<li>Don\u2019t delay. Recognizing the long-term costs and cultural impacts of not moving in this direction should be enough motivation for any insurer.<\/li><\/ul><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, creating a culture of change\u2014which means creating the environment that allows people to become comfortable with change\u2014needs to become part of the DNA of any insurer. Insurers who fail to start down this road risk running into their cultural dead end at some point\u2014that is if they haven\u2019t hit that dead end already.<\/p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Among the many challenges facing the insurance industry, none might be more critical\u2014and problematic\u2014than finding and keeping strong technical talent. And this is not a new problem. It has slowly but surely been creeping up on the industry for decades, as technology companies, the lure of startups and the industry\u2019s reputation for living behind the technology curve have all created disincentives for young technical talent to take a look at the industry.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what\u2019s the answer? In part, it's focusing on the assessment process as a way to find talent that others might overlook by measuring skill\u2014real and potential\u2014over experience. And much like the popular baseball book and movie <i>Moneyball<\/i>, the key to better assessing talent and outcomes is to know the right questions to ask.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><ul>This <i>Moneyball<\/i> approach promises several benefits:\r\n<li>First, it could provide the industry with an influx of strong IT talent that could help to move technology capabilities forward.<\/li>\r\n<li>Second, it could\u2014over time\u2014improve the quality of systems and processes in the industry, leading to better customer service overall and improved profitability.<\/li>\r\n<li>Third, it could enhance the efficiency of IT departments as they become restocked with fewer but more capable people.<\/li>\r\n<li>Fourth, it could start to break the perception of the industry as a backwater for technology innovation.<\/li><\/ul><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to accomplishing all of this is by improving the way in which technical talent is assessed. However, asking the right questions is something that seems easy, but actually isn\u2019t. It can only be learned through the bitter experience of asking many of the wrong questions, which leads to bad hires.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the keys to asking the right questions is to ask the questions that would likely arise while somebody was working in that position. To get a holistic view of the experiences and potential of each candidate, the interview questions should be organized into three categories that align with the desired position.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In the following examples, the positions used are an IT developer, a technical lead, or a junior architect. Through the above-mentioned trial and error, the question categories that have been developed over time for the interview include technical skills, previous successes\/failures and soft skills.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Technical skills<\/h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The assessment objective behind the Technical Skills category is to determine with some reasonableness of certainty that the candidate is or will be capable of developing quality software within a large project scope. Therefore, the specific questions will not focus on knowing <i>this<\/i> language or <i>that<\/i> configuration tool, but rather on a thoroughness of understanding of best practice coding patterns, testing, and integration techniques, and designing software for scalability and maintainability.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This approach generally leads to an insightful dialog and avoids simply checking yes and no boxes for specific skills. The focus is on the long-term probability of success for any given interviewee. The analogy to the <i>Moneyball<\/i> approach is that this qualitative approach is trying to get at how an interviewee will perform over a full season, given enough at-bats, pitching starts or other applicable metrics.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Previous success\/failures<\/h1>\r\n\r\n<p>This approach is continued for the two other main categories of the interview. For the Previous Success\/Failures category, the whole point here is that evaluating somebody based upon their experiences to date and extrapolating their development into some future point is usually a better success indicator than evaluating somebody on the specific skills listed on their resume.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the questions in this category focus on asking the candidate to tell a particular project story from their experience, why they thought it turned out the way it did, what they might do differently next time, and what they learned from the experience. This is a good opportunity to have the candidate use a whiteboard or some other medium that allows them to illustrate and elaborate. There are great insights in this category for a candidate\u2019s thinking and logic process, the technical and operational complexity of their experiences, and their organizational and communication skills.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Soft skills<\/h1>\r\n\r\n<p>For the final category, the previous discussion on the candidate\u2019s experiences can be used as input to evaluate their Soft Skills. Asking questions that center on <i>why<\/i> something works the way it does, or <i>why<\/i> certain decisions were made, are much more valuable than questions about <i>how<\/i> something works.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, answering the question of how to maintain software over time is a very different answer than why it's important to do so. Answering the why question leads to broader thinking about the value of software to a company, its relation to operational processes in the business, etc. There are no real right or wrong answers, and it again becomes an opportunity to have a conversation about a variety of things. The focus is mainly on communications, and the goal is to ascertain a candidate's ability to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><ul><li>Understand technical conversations<\/li>\r\n<li>Meaningfully contribute to technical conversations<\/li>\r\n<li>Summarize the technical details for others<\/li>\r\n<li>Participate in overall team dynamics<\/li><\/ul><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The premise posited here is that the insurance industry has a technical talent issue and that the suggested approach herein is one way to begin to address that issue. This approach is of course only one way, and other approaches may be equally effective.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The larger point is that the industry's overall approach to talent assessment needs to get better, and not just by a little bit. The consequences of not doing so are problematic and would leave the industry exposed to continuous innovation and technology deficit as compared to other sectors. That's why the industry needs to be proactive rather than reactive about talent assessment, and judging someone on their current skills even if they haven't had the experience to prove them out entirely is one way to do that. As the statistical analyst opined to his baseball general manager boss in <i>Moneyball<\/i>: \\\"Your goal shouldn't be to buy players. Your goal should be to buy wins. To buy wins, you need to buy runs.\\\" We need to score more runs.<\/p>",

        "content": "<p>A plethora of articles have been written on how the insurance industry should engage with younger generations of potential customers. Whether millennial, Gen X or Y or anything in-between, the industry has rightly recognized a shift in the research and buying patterns of younger consumers. As a millennial, this change has everything to do with growing up as near digital natives and thus having a different kind of relationship with technology and time than prior generations might have had. For most of the millennial generation then, that means that if it\u2019s not possible to use a mobile device to manage a relationship with an insurer, then we\u2019d just as soon move on, thank you very much.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now before devolving into stereotypical clich\u00E9s about what a millennial may or may not want, and why or why not that may be, it\u2019s important to understand that just like every prior generation, the millennial generation has their way of relating to the world around them. Objectively speaking, those ways are neither good nor bad; they\u2019re just the way the millennial perspective has evolved. So let\u2019s get specific. My generation has grown up in a world where researching and purchasing things (meals, books, cars, houses) can be accomplished online exclusively via mobile devices.  It should come as a shock to exactly nobody in the insurance industry that the same expectation for researching and purchasing would hold true for insurance. However, since that is not entirely possible at this point, it should also come as no surprise that most millennials tend to just skip the whole insurance thing, at least for now. This is due to many other influences as well, but online accessibility and ease of access remain the key prohibitors in millennials actively seeking insurance. That said, there is an opportunity here. As the millennial generation gets on with their lives, insurers who develop viable mobile interfaces along with targeted products and services can reap the financial rewards of selling into the most prominent demographic since the baby boomers. That\u2019s no small opportunity, and it should be one that insurers are stepping all over themselves to leverage.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way that the insurance industry might leverage that opportunity is to make investments now to begin to turn themselves into digital businesses. That doesn\u2019t mean that they won\u2019t have buildings or offices, but it does mean that they\u2019ll take a digital\/mobile-first approach to their next generations of customers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those insurers who are interested in going down this road, here are the basic millennial requirements:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><ul>\r\n<li>Researching and purchasing insurance happens online and can be completed in full by the customer.<\/li>\r\n<li>Any subsequent amendments, alterations or customizations happen online with text chat to answer any questions.<\/li>\r\n<li>Claim reporting happens online in real-time, with AI and robotic technologies to assist.<\/li>\r\n<li>Through the whole process, self-research and text chatting with a live person on the other end are fine, but wasting time on unproductive and inefficient phone calls should never be required.<\/li><\/ul><\/p>\r\n<p>This, of course, is a major change for the industry. But from a millennial perspective, is this a bigger change than what the retail, music, book, or countless other industries have gone through? Or should millennials infer that the insurance industry is just less interested in having them as customers than other industries are? Yes, it is all a matter perspective. For the millennial generation, technology exists to make life \u2013 and everything that\u2019s part of it \u2013 easier and more manageable. If a given technology, or industry, doesn\u2019t achieve that then millennials are loath to have anything to do with it unless absolutely necessary, and even then grudgingly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>And for the millennial generation\u2014and this is important to the insurance industry\u2014technology is directly related to time. What does that mean? That means that the millennial generation has a relationship with time\u2014managing it, wasting it, accumulating it\u2014that is quite different from prior generations. The millennial generation has grown up in an era of high-speed networking, social technologies, and for better or worse, near instant gratification. This means that any technology or service that can save us time is a technology or service that we want in our lives. Yes, this is part of the clich\u00E9d list of complaints that our parents and grandparents have of this generation, along with every kid gets a trophy, etc. However, that\u2019s how we were wired, and that\u2019s no different in the abstract than our parent\u2019s generation being wired for rock and roll and protests, and our grandparent\u2019s generation being wired for the greatest generation and suburban bliss. It\u2019s just part of the millennial experience set, and the insurance industry would be well advised to recognize it and make plans to deal with it sooner rather than later.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>So no thank you. The millennial generation is not interested in waiting on hold to report a claim, or waiting for days for an insurance policy or product to be completed, or filling out seemingly endless and redundant forms only to be told that our information can\u2019t be located by the branch office, or to have a nurse come into our home for an intrusive exam for a life insurance application. Like electricity, this generation will flow to the paths of least resistance and will look for other ways to get the insurance type products needed \u2013 hello Insurtech startups \u2013 rather than dealing with an industry that doesn\u2019t care to understand our needs. The demographic reality is that the millennial generation will need insurance products as it starts businesses and families, and purchases homes and cars. The demand will be there, so the supply just needs to get aligned in a way that is more palatable and consumable for the millennial generation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>So drop us a text insurance industry, and let us know how you\u2019re doing. Oh wait, your old system can\u2019t text\u2014we have a problem.<\/p>",

		"content": "<p>The term \"data quality\" used to be reserved for highly technical conversations in the bowels of an insurer\u2019s IT division as database developers and administrators discussed a new or existing database. That has all changed over the past several years. Now that term is discussed in insurance executive and even board meetings as part of discussions about how any insurer plans, operates and grows in its chosen marketplace. In short, data quality has quickly become synonymous with business quality, complete with the corresponding implications on operational effectiveness, competitive differentiation and profitability.<\/p><p>This three-part series will focus on creating a new or improving an existing, data quality management strategy and implementation approach that accounts for the elevated and strategic importance of data quality management in any insurer. And the core of any strategic data quality management strategy is the following components: detection, notification and remediation. Part one of this series will focus on <b>Detection<\/b>.<\/p><p>Whether it has been formally created or has just evolved, every insurer has a data quality management strategy. Any time that data is aggregated, organized, and used for business purposes there is an implicit data quality strategy in place.<\/p><p>For this series of articles, the concepts and approaches described will be based on an enterprise data warehouse (EDW) strategy and architecture approach. That is the most common approach in the insurance industry and involves various source systems (SOR) that generate data that is maintained in a separate repository\/warehouse (EDW) for purposes of producing reports, visualizations, portals, etc., as part of a business intelligence (BI) stack. No matter the data quality approach, however, at some point in time something will go wrong, and that\u2019s where a sound data quality detection approach is critical.<\/p><p>In that context, data quality exceptions can be seen as both strategic and tactical. In the most severe instance, a strategic data quality exception can be akin to a wildfire\u2014when it\u2019s raging everyone sees it (detection), everyone knows about it (notification) and everyone is mobilized to address it (remediation). Such a scenario, just like an actual wildfire, should be a rare occurrence.<\/p><p>The distinction between a strategic and tactical data quality approach is that in a strategic approach the methods are proactive and intended to be preventative. The ultimate goal is that every critical data quality exception is detected before consumption in the BI Stack. And minimally, that some notification occurs to allow a Data Steward to begin planning a remediation along with forewarning key stakeholders.<\/p><p>Conversely, data quality exceptions that are ad hoc and unaccounted for and require immediate remediation fall into the category of tactical data quality issues. Such exceptions generally cannot be planned for or prevented due to multiple unknowns and variables. They simply must be dealt with on an ad hoc basis. That said, such exceptions are useful for their educational value toward preventing future data quality exceptions, or at least in identifying methods that can be implemented to enable more proactive data quality control. In any case, any and all data quality exceptions should be managed and cataloged in business rules to prevent their recurrence.<\/p><p>Besides the program bugs and process flaws that should get detected and remediated as part of a pre-production review, there are often latent flaws that appear in the post-production phase of any system implementation. In fact, tactical data quality exceptions can arise even when the detection process is working as designed. That often occurs when the SOR allows the creation of data that violates the implemented business rules.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/><h1>Detection<\/h1><p>Detecting a data quality exception can be either intentional (proactive) or accidental (reactive). Generally speaking, an accidental detection becomes a tactical data quality exception and is managed accordingly. The focus of a data quality management strategy as it concerns detection is around intentional detection as this fulfills the strategic data quality objective to proactively prevent the consumption of invalid data.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/><h1>Pre\u2014Intra\u2014Post<\/h1><p>Intentional data quality detection may occur both before and after invalid data is persisted in the EDW. Once a data quality issue is identified and categorized\u2014and therefore anticipated\u2014a detection method can be implemented in either the pre-EDW or intra-EDW phase. If however, a data quality issue is unaccounted for it can be detected as part of a post-EDW audit where it can then be identified and categorized. In either case, the appropriate notification and remediation steps will follow the detections.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/><h1>Exception Level\/Severity<\/h1><p>The assumption that invalid data should never be persisted in an EDW is a sound one, at least in theory. However, in real-world scenarios, such an approach can be too restrictive and could, in fact, cause more problems than intended. There are cases where it might be better to allow invalid data to be persisted, at least temporarily, as that would cause less damage than the potential damage to the overall EDW. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to create a robust data quality detection process that allows for levels of severity based on business rules. Done well, these exception levels can control how the EDW process will continue based on detection severity\u2014or not\u2014and the conditions under which detection notification occurs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/><h1>Business Rules<\/h1><p>A strong set of business rules is a necessary part of any data management strategy. Business rules affect the way any data is sourced, transformed, and acted upon when data quality exceptions are detected in the EDW. The rules should be created pre-production but will likely get altered during the intra and post-production phases as unanticipated scenarios arise. Ultimately though, there should be a repository of data quality business rules focused on detecting data quality exceptions.<\/p><p>An example of a sound EDW business rule could be something like:<\/p><p><i>Valid Status Codes are characters in this range (\u2018\u2019,0-9, A-G), any exceptions are allowed to flow into EDW, but a notification must be sent to data steward as a level 2, including the key of source record and value detected.<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/><h1>Logging Exceptions<\/h1><p>Operational procedures that deal with any data-related issued should be handled by a DevOps group. If and when a particular issue is identified as a data quality exception, it must be logged and categorized for remediation. A good data management strategy practice is to track every data quality exception in some purpose-built repository for historical reporting (MS Excel may suffice) and to associate each exception in accordance with the following attributes:<\/p><p><ul>\r\n<li><b>Detection Point<\/b> \u2013 as specific as possible, job, script, procedure, SQL, or other<\/li>\r\n<li><b>EDW Target Affected<\/b> \u2013 table, column, other<\/li>\r\n<li><b>Source Object<\/b> \u2013 file, table, column, other<\/li>\r\n<li><b>Exception<\/b> \u2013 Rule ID, DBMS error, other<\/li>\r\n<li><b>Notification Action<\/b> \u2013 none, level, Data Steward, other<\/li>\r\n<li><b>Root Cause<\/b> \u2013 post analysis comments<\/li>\r\n<li><b>Status<\/b> \u2013 to track remediation<\/li>\r\n<\/ul><\/p><p>Implementing a process for detecting data quality exceptions is the first foundational pillar toward creating an effective data management strategy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/><p>In part two of this series, the focus will be on the next foundational pillar: <b>Notification<\/b>.<\/p>",
