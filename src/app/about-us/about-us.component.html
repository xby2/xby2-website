        <h1>A Different Approach</h1>
        <p>
          Why does the world need another IT consulting firm? It doesn't, at least
          not the typical IT consulting firm. Firms over promising and under
          delivering when it comes to quality and results. Firms that use their
          connections rather than client outcomes to generate future sales. Firms
          that create a cycle of dependence with their clients to generate continued
          revenue for themselves. Firms with "strategic partnerships" that undermine
          objectivity and taint consulting analyses with bias. Firms where
          successful delivery is achieved only sometimes, and accountability for
          results is rare to find. Firms where the "A" team makes the sale and the
          "B" team is brought in to deliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          A different approach was needed. With this premise, X by 2 was founded in
          1998 on a different set of principles to do what is lacking in typical IT
          consulting firms.

          In the end, it turns out that a different approach is exactly what the
          industry desired, creating the opportunity for X by 2 to serve some of
          the most forward thinking insurance and healthcare organizations in
          North America over the last 20 years.

          Our day-to-day architecture practice is different than what it was in
          1998, and it will be different in the future for certain. Thatâ€™s business
          and technology for you. But our core principles and beliefs have not
          changed and will continue to define who we are as a company and how we
          approach serving our clients.
