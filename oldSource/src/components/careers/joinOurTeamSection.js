      <p>
        Joining any team is not something anybody should take lightly. Likewise,
        asking somebody to join your team is always a leap of consideration and
        confidence. At X by 2 we take a very serious approach toward asking
        people to join the team. We’re not a body shop or a huge consultancy
        that keeps the revolving door constantly in motion. Rather, we’re a
        boutique consultancy that only has an “A” team, and because we tell our
        clients that we have to live up to it when we extend offers. Our vetting
        process is rigorous and considered, but when we extend an offer we are
        confident in the ultimate success of those we hire. We are a true
        meritocracy, where there are no passengers, only drivers. That approach
        has created a consultancy composed of a diversity of backgrounds and
        experiences, and has resulted in one of the things we value most: a
        diversity of thought.
